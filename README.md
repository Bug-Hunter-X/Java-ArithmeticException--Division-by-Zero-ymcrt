# Java ArithmeticException: Division by Zero

This repository demonstrates a common Java error: the `ArithmeticException` that occurs when dividing by zero.

The `bug.java` file contains code that attempts to divide by zero.  The `bugSolution.java` file provides a corrected version that handles this potential error.

This is a simple example, but it highlights the importance of error handling in robust code.
